# Who's Winning? Poker Hand Trainer

So, I got a poker set for Christmas - yay! I started playing poker over the summer, but I'm not very good at it. My biggest issue that I can't read the board very quickly and also understand the potential of my hand. So, I built this!

Poker Hand Trainer is a web-based poker training tool designed to help players improve their hand reading abilities in Texas Hold'em. Practice identifying winning hands at every stage of the game, from pre-flop to river.

## Features
- Interactive hand evaluation practice
- Support for 2-8 players
- Real-time feedback at each stage (pre-flop, flop, turn, river)
- Complete hand rankings reference
- Accurate poker hand evaluation with proper tie-breaking
- Instant feedback on your winning hand predictions

## How It Works
1. Select the number of players (2-8)
2. At each stage, identify who you think is winning
3. Progress through the hand (flop, turn, river)
4. Get feedback on your predictions and see the actual winning hands
5. Learn from comparing your guesses to the correct evaluations
